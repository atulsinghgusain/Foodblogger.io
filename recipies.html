         <h2 style="color: red"> 1) curry</h2>
         <p style="color: white">Curry (plural curries) is a variety of dishes originating in the Indian subcontinent that use a complex combination of spices or herbs, usually including ground turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, and fresh or dried chilies. Curry is generally prepared in a sauce.[1] Curry dishes prepared in the southern states of India, where the word also originated, may be spiced with leaves from the curry tree.There are many varieties of dishes called 'curries'. For example, in original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference. Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods.Spices are used both whole and ground, cooked or raw, and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results. The main spices found in most curry powders of the Indian subcontinent are coriander, cumin, and turmeric. A wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included (fish, lentils, red or white meat, rice, and vegetables).Curry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices, is largely a Western creation, dating to the 18th century. Such mixtures are commonly thought to have first been prepared by Indian merchants for sale to members of the British Colonial government and army returning to Britain.</p>

         <h2 style="color: red"> 2)dal makhani   </h2>
         <p style="color: white">1. Use whole spices â€“ I tried many times to get the restaurant taste in the dal makhani I make at home. But it never came close. I remember once having dal makhani (and it was one of the best dal makhani, we have had) in goa. We have had dal makhani at this place many times, at the quiet and serene benaulim beach in goa. Surprise, surprise I once found black cardamom and a clove in the dal makhni. I thought may be it is the black cardamom and clove giving that flavor. When we make dal makhani at home, we never add whole spices or whole garam masala. Instead we add garam masala powder. Thereafter I made it many times with the whole spices and it does make a difference. But I still felt something was missing..<br>
         	2. It is important to add a good amount of cream and butter in dal makhani. When I cracked the recipe of Dal bukhara, I felt it was the cream and butter making this difference, apart from the slow cooking. I would always add less butter or oil (2 tablespoons for 1 to 1.25 cups of lentils) and make dal makhani with no cream or very less cream. You could still make dal makhani with less butter and cream. Just remember to slow cook it for longer periods of time, to get the real deal.<br>
             3. The more slow cooked dal makhni is, the better it tastes. initially I have cooked the lentils in a pressure cooker for about 30 minutes. But later I have slow cooked on a low flame for 25 minutes.<br>
